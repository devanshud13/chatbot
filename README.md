# Moviebot Mike [applink](https://moviebot-mike.herokuapp.com/)
Mike predicts 9 user intents, makes recommendations for about 200 IMDb 7+ rated Bollywood movies from the 2010 - 2019 era based on plot similarity, gives movie plots, and drops movie dialogues in the conversation.

***NOTE:** The web app is deployed on a free server which goes into sleep mode and takes about 10s for boot up, once loaded the bot will work as expected.*

## Extended Features

| Feature&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Description |
| :----       |    :----   |
| **Unk Handler**| Implemented a module to replace out of vocabulary words (words not seen in training) detected in a user request with 'unk' to gain maximum information out of the request, the UNK percent in the bot response refers to that.|
| **Movie Title Spellings**| To handle variations of movie title spelling, implemented a module that computes Levenstein distance between user input movie title and the ones in the database to capture appropriate movie title given by the user.|
| **Profanity Handler**| Implemented an intent that tries to detect swear words in a user's request. |
